A web application built in Python to parse YouTube music URLs and get relative information (like; artist name, song name, etc.) using [ytmusicapi]('https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/'). This information is then used to get song data from Spotify using [Spotify API]('https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api'). Pretty simple, right? ðŸ™ƒ But you can do it manually / searching for the song and artist name on Spotify by yourself, so the question is:

## Why will you want to use this?

I don't know, it's kool... ðŸ˜³
